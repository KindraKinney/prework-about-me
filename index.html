      <p>Northwest born and raised.  I grew up in Bellevue and went to college at Seattle Pacific University.
        Currently I coordinate rental furniture for staging with a company.  I have learned many valuable skills
        doing this position, but there's not much opportunity for upward mobility. I am excited to be taking this course
        and learn new skills that will lead to a new career path.
